<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


Tunes Checker is a desktop application for checking the integrity of an iTunes library.  

The application reads an 'iTunes Library.xml' file and compares its contents to the actual files found in the Media Music folder, reporting any discrepancies. 


<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>


<h3 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h3>


Tunes Checker is written in Java and can run on any reasonably modern operating system, including Mac OS X, Windows and Linux. Tunes Checker requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), also known as a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The version of this JRE/JVM must be at least 6. Visit [www.java.com](http://www.java.com) to download a recent version for most operating systems. Installation happens a bit differently under Mac OS X, but generally will occur fairly automatically when you try to launch a Java app for the first time.

Because Tunes Checker may be run on multiple platforms, it may look slightly different on different operating systems, and will obey slightly different conventions (using the CMD key on a Mac, vs. an ALT key on a PC, for example).

Download the latest version from [PowerSurgePub.com](http://www.powersurgepub.com/downloads.html). Decompress the downloaded file. Drag the resulting file or folder into the location where you normally store your applications. Double-click on the jar file (or the application, if you've downloaded the Mac app) to launch.

<h2 id="help">Help</h2>


The following commands are available. Note that the first two commands open local documentation installed with your application, while the next group of commands will access the Internet and access the latest program documentation, where applicable.

* **Program History** -- Opens the program's version history in your preferred Web browser.

* **User Guide** -- Opens the program's user guide in your preferred Web browser.

* **Check for Updates** -- Checks the PowerSurgePub web site to see if you're running the latest version of the application.

* **Tunes Checker Home Page** -- Open's the Tunes Checker product page on the World-Wide Web.

* **Reduce Window Size** -- Restores the main Tunes Checker window to its default size and location. Note that this command has a shortcut so that it may be executed even when the Tunes Checker window is not visible. This command may sometimes prove useful if you use multiple monitors, but occasionally in different configurations. On Windows in particular, this sometimes results in Tunes Checker opening on a monitor that is no longer present, making it difficult to see.
